## EXERCISE THREE: Looping With Objects!

**NOTE:** Be sure to use your built-in object methods and the `for...in` loops we covered in the curriculum videos.

1. [ ] Note the structure of the `pizzaPlace` object. Pay attention to the data types and structure.

2. [ ] Write a function, `printPizzaPlace`. It should iterate over every key-value pair in the object and print them in pairs.

3. [ ] Write a function, `toppingsPriceRange`, that iterates over the nested `pizzaToppings` object and returns the highest and lowest topping prices in a two-element array. **DO NOT** assume the prices or number of toppings are fixed for any `pizzaPlace`.

4. [ ] Write a function, `calculateAverageRating`, that intakes a `pizzaPlace` object and returns the average number of stars from the star reviews it has received from users.
