## Object Basics

### Learning Goals

By the end of these three modules, you will be able to:

- Read and write object literals
- Adjust or set the properties on objects
- Use built-in methods for objects
- Understand how to iterate over the kets in the object.

### How It All Works

1. There are three modules that will walk you through the basics of Objects, Methods, and Iterating on Objects.
2. Each Module has a coorosponding curriculum video and exercise.
3. The .md files on the left contain instructions for each exercise. **_READ THEM CAREFULLY_**
4. The .js files on the left are where you can work your coding magic!
5. The solutions folder contains possible solutions for all exercises. Don't reference these until you have arrived at an answer!

### Testing Your Work

If you would like to test your work along the way, feel free to run the below command:

```
node name-of-file
```

Be sure to replace name-of-file with the name of the file you want to run!

#### **I highly encourage you to use console.log to check values and the return values of functions along the way. This is the best way to see if you are on the right track!**

### Happy Coding!
